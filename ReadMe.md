# fff-lang

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/FreskyZ/fff-lang.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FreskyZ/fff-lang)

A small language for fun

## Features (in design)

  - based on C syntax
  - sweet modern syntax extensions learned from rust, python, C#, etc.
  - type inference and concept based generic
  - static reflection
  - no 3rd party library dependency, include c library, llvm, ld or link
  - whole process from source code file to in memory IR or target binary

## Build

  it's in a huge refactor process and driver is broken currently...  
  use `cargo test` in `codemap`, `lexical`, `syntax` and `semantic` crates  
  or switch to tag v0.1.0 to view compiler course homework handin version

## Other things

  This is my first open source project!  
  ~~It is not private because github does not support alipay~~  
  'fff' means 'Fresky's Favorite Feature' ~~not a group name~~  
  welcome your issues and pull requests
