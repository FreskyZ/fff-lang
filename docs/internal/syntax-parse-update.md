- [x] merge ISyntaxParse and ISyntaxGrammar to Node, provide default return false implementation for matches_first
- [x] add make_lit for making LitExpr node, macro syntax similar to lexical t!
- [x] change ISyntaxFormat to Visitor
- [x] pass test
- [x] add take address expression
- [x] rename type use to type ref
- [x] rename session to context, rename sess to cx, remove `<F>` from SourceChars, lexical::Parser and ParseContext
- [x] split Node into Node and Parser, and ParserOutput can be trait Parser { type Output: Node }, remove default implementation for parse and accept
- [x] change array type ref to rust style `[type; size]` syntax, add function type ref, reference type ref and change type ref to an abc
- [x] add keyword kind identifierable, and intern them when meet in lexical parser, that will make string list consistent (same as appear in source code)
- [x] add FormatVisitor::impl_visit(name, all_span)
- [x] discard all other use of simple name, merge simple name into name, accept generic part in name segment
- [x] add object literal syntax, it can fits in postfix expr with require base expr is an name
- [x] add simple enum type, works as typed namespaced constant
- [x] move multiple file operations from syntaxtree.rs into driver, add file id to module
- [x] discard test constructors and use make_xxxx macros, merge make_lit into make_expr, remove make_exprs, try add make_stmt
- [x] move node definitions to one file, move node implementations (impl Node) to one file, move parse tests to several dedicated files
- [x] remove jumpstatement from node, copy fields to breakstatement and continuestatement
- [x] move parse functions to several dedicated files, then ParseContext's context (allow object literal, is in format string literal, etc.) may can be pass by parameter not save in ParseContext
- [-] fix random test input generator
- [ ] add missing array dup def
- [x] unify name segment and plain type segment into path segment, path segment contains variants of ident, ident + generic, type-cast
- [x] split tuple index expr from member expr, rename index expr to array index expr
- [x] allow generic parameter in type name and fn name, that's called parse_generic_name
- [x] allow where clause when generic name
- [ ] add numeric literal type as suffixed/unsuffixed and bin/oct/dec/hex/unprefixed, member access require unsuffixed and unprefixed
- [ ] format string
- [ ] add impl type and impl trait for type
