# fff-lang Designment Document

## Iterator and coroutine object designment

first versions maybe similiar to C++ and python, which only requires a begin and end method in iterable type definition and an increase and a dereference method in iterator type definition, plus simple iteration stop control, which is technically called 'duck type'
