Test standarlization actually is make every test no output to stdout or stderr

[16/1/30 23:10 @ a08b929]
every crate's tests' stderr output line length
codemap: 0
lexical: 0
lexical_pos: 0
ffc: 330 1737 11083 (wc result)

[16/2/6 16:44 @ 989457ba]
STDOUT length:
    lexical: 217 1019 6730
    ffc: 377 2947 23932
    codemap: 0
    messages: 0
    codepos: 0
    util: 0
Analyze:
    ffc is worth mainly because position types and new message's debug contains more info and display longer

[17/2/24 23:41 @ 68d86de]
stdout length:
    ffc: 387 2918 23444
    lexical: 134 583 4504
Analyze:
    lexical is much better
    ffc is a little worth because message formating is a little more complex

stdout length:
    driver: 237 1557 11357
    lexical: 8 37 312 
Analyze: 
    driver I don't know, partially because main and config is moved out
    lexical nearly finished
