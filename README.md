# fff-lang

A small language for fun

## Features (in design)

- modern syntax learned from rust, python, C#, etc.
- manual memory management and RAII
- first class function
- concept based generic
- interpret, REPL or native binary codegen
- no 3rd party library dependency (for now) (because there isn't when initially bootstrapping)

## Build

- use `cargo ut` to run unit tests
- use `cargo rt` to run intergrated tests
- use `cargo rc` to run the compiler binary, `cargo rc -- --help` for help

## Other things

This was my first open source project!  
'fff' means 'Fresky's Favorite Feature' ~~not a group name~~
